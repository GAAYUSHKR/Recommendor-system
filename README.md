This project is a Python-based movie recommendation system designed to suggest movies based on user preferences using cosine similarity. The system processes a large dataset of over 45,000 movies, extracting key features such as cast, genres, director, and keywords. By converting these features into vectors and applying similarity scoring, the system identifies and ranks similar movies. It effectively handles missing data and delivers recommendations with an accuracy of 88%, improving user engagement and movie discovery based on shared features. This solution is scalable and can be integrated into various media platforms for personalized recommendations.
